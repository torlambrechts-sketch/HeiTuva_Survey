# Deviations from the Orgpuls design bundle

Every place the built application departs from `design-reference/orgpuls/Orgpuls.dc.html`,
with the reason and the constraint that forced it. A deviation is a decision that was
logged; it is not permission to depart again elsewhere.

---

## D-01 — The privacy threshold's minimum is 5, not 3

**Bundle:** `Orgpuls.dc.html:2488` declares the `threshold` prop as an integer with
`min: 3, max: 10, default: 5`, in the "Personvern" section. A user could therefore set
the published-result group size down to 3.

**Built:** `app.organizations.threshold` is `check (threshold between 5 and 10)`, and
`app.k_threshold()` floors whatever it finds at `app.k_min()`, which is a function
returning 5 and so cannot be altered by data
(`supabase/migrations/0001_foundation.sql`).

**Constraint that forced it:** CLAUDE.md security invariant 1 — *"k-anonymity, k=5,
database-enforced"* — and its stop-and-ask list, which names *"lowering
`app.k_threshold()`"* as something that may not be done without a decision. Where the
bundle and that contract disagree, the contract wins on security and the bundle wins on
visuals.

The product's own statutory report states the rule in the same terms, so 5 is also what
the design *says* even though the control would permit 3:

> "Resultater vises ikke for grupper med færre enn 5 svar. Administrasjon (3 svar) er
> derfor kun med i helheten, ikke som egen gruppe."

**Visible consequence:** the Personvern control offers 5–10 rather than 3–10. This is a
visible difference from the bundle on one control in one sub-tab. Raising the threshold
above 5 works exactly as designed.

**Proven by:** `INV-1`, six assertions — floor value, rejection at create, rejection at
update, acceptance of a raise, rejection above the ceiling, and floor-not-null for an
unknown org. All six passed on 2026-09-22.

## D-02 — Avatar images are placeholders

**Bundle:** `Orgpuls_Offline_Source.html` declares nine avatar images as
`ext-resource-dependency`: `tuva/av1.png`, `av3`, `av4`, `av5`, `av7`, `av11`, `av12`,
`av13`, `av15`.

**Built:** not yet supplied, so they render as the bundle's own empty image slot.

**Consequence:** avatars are not pixel-exact. Visible as the blank circle beside "Tuva"
in the header and the blank square in the Tuva callout on Innsikt. Every other pixel on
those screens is unaffected.

**Resolution:** awaiting the image files. Not worked around, not substituted.

## D-03 — Authentication has no design

**Bundle:** contains no login, onboarding, or marketing surface. Twelve screens, all of
them behind an implied session, with a role switcher and an account avatar in the header.

**Built:** a minimal sign-in built strictly from the bundle's existing primitives — card
surface `#FFFDF6`, hairline border `#E8DFC9`, primary button `#F5C64A`, the focus ring
from bundle line 23 — inventing no new visual language, no new colour, and no new control
class.

**Constraint that forced it:** the application cannot be reached without authentication,
and CLAUDE.md forbids inventing features. Decided by the user on 2026-09-21 in preference
to Entra-only sign-in, waiting for an auth design, or a development stub.

**Consequence:** this is the one surface with no pixel baseline, so the pixel gate cannot
cover it. It is verified by the other six gates only.

## D-04 — `rls_enabled_no_policy` on `responses` and `answers` is intended

Not a deviation from the design, but a standing note, because it looks like a defect in
Supabase's own security advisor and will keep being reported:

> `Table app.answers has RLS enabled, but no policies exist`
> `Table app.responses has RLS enabled, but no policies exist`

That is the invariant, not an oversight. Clients never read raw responses; every result
read goes through a SECURITY DEFINER aggregate that applies k. RLS is enabled with no
policy so the default is deny for every role, and the grants are revoked as well.

**Do not "fix" this finding by adding a select policy.** Doing so silently removes
k-anonymity from the entire product.
